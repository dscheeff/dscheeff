Hi, Iâ€™m David Scheeff. 

My expertise lies in Solutions Architecture, JD Edwards CNC Leadership, and Cloud Solutions, with extensive experience in technology solutions implementation, troubleshooting, and support, along with an MSEE degree. I have a deep background in setting up infrastructures for ERP software, with successful results across multiple companies.  

I have been interested in Machine Learning since graduate school.  If you have a need for an ML-Ops engineer let me know.  In the meantime I'm creating a portfolio to demonstrate my Data Science and Machine Learning knowledge.
